                    <img src="images/portfolio-img1.jpg"  alt="BlackJack game">
					<p>A blackjack card game game built using Python and multiple classes which consists of several different classes, 
                        each with its own specific role in the game. For example, there is a Card class that represents a single playing card, 
                        with attributes like its suit and value. There is a Deck class that contains a collection of Card objects and has 
                        methods for shuffling the deck and dealing cards.
                        <br>
                        Another class is the Player class, which represents a player in the game and has attributes like 
                        their current hand and the amount of money they have. This class  also has methods for taking actions like hitting or standing.
                        <br>
                        The main Blackjack class then coordinates the overall game, including managing the deck of cards, 
                        keeping track of each player's hands and money, and determining the winner at the end of each round.
                         This class also havs methods for handling user input and displaying the game state to the player.
                        <br>
                        Overall, the game is structured in a way that allows for easy expansion and customization, 
                        with the different classes working together to provide a fun and interactive blackjack experience for the player.
